Before you run it make sure you have node 6+ installed and then you can run npm install -g @angular/cli

The application is split in server and client folders.

To start you must first go to each both client and server folders and "npm install" to download the dependencies.

Then you start the server by running "npm start" in the server folder and on another terminal window you start the client by running "npm start" in the client.

When the client starts you can visit localhost:4200 to check out the application.
